Meta's Llama 2 represents a sophisticated evolution in LLMs. This suite spans models pretrained and fine-tuned across a parameter spectrum of 7 billion to 70 billion. A specialized derivative, Llama 2-Chat, has been engineered explicitly for dialogue-centric applications. Benchmarking revealed Llama 2's superior performance over most extant open-source chat models. Human-centric evaluations, focusing on safety and utility metrics, positioned Llama 2-Chat as a potential contender against proprietary, closed-source counterparts. The development trajectory of Llama 2 emphasized rigorous fine-tuning methodologies. Meta's transparent delineation of these processes aims to catalyze community-driven advancements in LLMs, underscoring a commitment to collaborative and responsible AI development. Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models: Code Llama, the foundational code model;Codel Llama - Python specialized for Python;and Code Llama - Instruct, which is fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions. Based on its benchmark testing, Code Llama outperformed state-of-the-art publicly available LLMs (except GPT-4) on code tasks. Llama 2, Llama 2-Chat, and Code Llama are key steps in LLM development but still have a way to go compared to GPT-4. Meta's open access and commitment to improving these models promise transparent and faster LLM progress in the future. Please refer to the LLM and Llama variants below:  From LLMs to Multimodal LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), primarily focus on understanding and generating human language.

These are a new breed of AI models that can understand and generate not just text, but also images, sounds, and potentially other types of data. The term \"multimodal\" refers to their ability to process multiple modes or types of data simultaneously. This is a game-changer. Imagine an AI that can not only read a description of a dress but also visualize it or even design it! Multimodal AI models are moving us towards more holistic AI systems. These systems can potentially understand our world in a more comprehensive manner, bridging the gap between different forms of data and providing richer, more integrated solutions. As we stand on the cusp of this new era, it's exciting to envision the myriad of applications and innovations that Multimodal models will bring to the table. The future of AI looks more integrated and versatile than ever before.  From Connections to Vector DB The AI landscape is witnessing a fascinating transition: from Language Model (LLM) connections or integrations, e.g., LangChain and LlamaIndex, to the rise of Vector Databases (Vector DB) such as Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, Chroma, and Vespa.ai. But what's driving this shift, and why does it matter? LLM connections, like the LlamaIndex, primarily focus on linking and understanding vast amounts of external data. They've been pivotal in creating semantic connections, enabling more intuitive search experiences, and enhancing data accessibility. However, as the volume and variety of data grow, the need for more advanced storage and retrieval mechanisms becomes evident. This is where Vector DBs come into play.

The rise of Vector DBs represents a broader trend in AI: the quest for more efficient, scalable, and versatile data handling solutions. As we navigate this evolution, it's clear that the combination of LLMs and Vector DBs will redefine how we store, access, and understand data in the AI-driven future.  From Agents to OS The AI realm is abuzz with innovations, and one of the most intriguing shifts we're witnessing is the transition from LLM agents to using LLMs as Operating Systems (OS). Let's delve into this evolution and its implications. LLM agents, like AutoGPT, AgentGPT, BabyAGI, and HuggingGPT, have been groundbreaking in automating tasks based on user requests. These agents leverage the power of Language Models (LLMs) to understand and execute commands, making them invaluable in tasks ranging from content generation to data analysis. Their adaptability and intelligence have made them a staple in many AI toolkits. However, the vision for AI doesn't stop there. The concept of LLM as an OS is emerging as the next big thing. Imagine an operating system where the core is a language model, orchestrating everything around it. Such a system would not just execute tasks but would understand context, anticipate needs, and offer solutions in real time. It's like turning the LLM into the brain of the digital ecosystem, making devices and applications more intuitive and responsive than ever. The move towards LLM as OS signifies a paradigm shift in how we perceive and utilize AI. It's not just about automation anymore; it's about creating a seamless, intelligent interface",

From Fine-tuning to Plugins The world of LLMs is undergoing a transformative shift, moving from intricate fine-tuning processes to the more dynamic realm of plugins. Let's unpack this evolution. Historically, fine-tuning has been the cornerstone of LLM optimization. There are two primary ways to fine-tune LLMs: feeding data into the LLM in real-time and directly fine-tuning on the LLM. From a technical standpoint, this involves three methods: Transfer Learning: Adapting a pre-trained model to new tasks.Sequential Fine-tuning: Refining models in stages for specific tasks.Task-specific Fine-tuning: Tailoring models for a particular function. Moreover, LLM techniques like In-context learning, Few-shot learning, and Zero-shot learning have further enhanced the model's adaptability, allowing them to understand and generate content with minimal data. However, the future of LLMs is leaning towards plugins. With the introduction of tools like GPT-4 Plugins, the focus is on extending LLMs seamlessly. Instead of running LLMs as a service, they're envisioned as platforms. This means integrating LLMs with various tools, enhancing their capabilities, and offering a more modular and scalable approach to AI applications. The journey from fine-tuning to plugins represents a move from static optimization to dynamic adaptability, ensuring that LLMs remain at the forefront of AI innovation.

To complement LangChain, the web application is built utilizing Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications and data dashboards. Streamlit's open-source nature and user-friendly features simplify the process of developing web apps with minimal effort. This has made it a popular choice among developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers seeking to build engaging and accessible applications.  Initial setup Install OpenAI, LangChain, and StreamLit Import the relevant packages Set the API keys Define the LLM to use  Ingesting private documents We used Langchain to ingest data. LangChain offers a wide range of data ingestion methods, providing users with various options to load their data efficiently. It supports multiple formats, including text, images, PDFs, Word documents, and even data from URLs. In the current example, text files were utilized, but if you wish to work with a different format, you simply need to refer to the corresponding loader specifically tailored for that format. All the analysts' recommendations documents are stored in a dedicated folder. You have the flexibility to either refer to individual documents or retrieve all the documents within a specific folder. If you want to specify exact documents, you can do it the following way. To load the files you want to ingest, you can specify the path to each file individually. The loaded files can then be saved into a list. This list serves as the input that is sent to the vector database to store the data. The alternative approach is a more versatile method in which we can load all pertinent documents from a designated folder and store the file locations in a list for subsequent processing. This approach offers flexibility and allows for the efficient handling of multiple documents by capturing their locations in a centralized list, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.

This approach offers flexibility and allows for the efficient handling of multiple documents by capturing their locations in a centralized list, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.  Load the documents into the vector store. When dealing with a vast number of documents, it becomes inefficient to send all documents (analyst recommendations) to your large language model (LLM) when seeking answers to specific questions. For instance, if your question pertains to MSFT, it would be more cost-effective to only send document extracts that reference MSFT to your LLM for answering the question. This approach helps optimize resource utilization. To achieve this, all documents are split into chunks and stored in a vector database in a numeric format (embeddings). When a new question is posed, the system queries the vector database for relevant text chunks related to this question, which is then shared with the LLM to generate an appropriate response. Within the LangChain framework, the VectorstoreIndexCreator class serves as a utility for creating a vector store index. This index stores vector representations of the documents (in chromadb), enabling various text operations, such as finding similar documents based on a specific question. When a user asks a question, a similarity search is performed in the vector store to get document chunks relevant to the question. The question, along with the chunks are sent to OpenAI to get the response back. Now we are ready to query these documents.  Setting up the web application The application is presented in the browser using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface.

Create a prompt based on the question asked by the user and display the response back to the user By calling index.query() with the specified parameters, you initiate the process of querying the vector database using the provided question. Vector database provides relevant text chunks that are relevant to the question asked. These text chunks, along with the original question, is passed to LLM. The LLM is invoked to analyze the question and generate a response based on the available data sent. The specific chaining process associated with the query is determined by the chain_type parameter, which is to use all the data (filtered by the question) sent to LLM. Now the entire application is ready, and let's take it for a spin next.  Ask few questions Let's try few questions The range of questions encompasses diverse facets of stock analysis, encompassing price forecasts, analyst recommendations, and recent rating changes. The chat system excels in delivering precise answers by leveraging the information contained within the financial documents. The system extends beyond individual stock inquiries and accommodates comparative queries across multiple stocks. For instance, one can ask about the stock with the highest price increase, prompting the system to compare price increases across all stocks and provide a comprehensive response. This versatility allows users to gain insights and make informed decisions across a broader spectrum of stock analysis.
