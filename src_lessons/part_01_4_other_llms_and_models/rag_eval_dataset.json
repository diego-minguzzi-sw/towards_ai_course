Meta's Llama 2 represents a sophisticated evolution in LLMs. This suite spans models pretrained and fine-tuned across a parameter spectrum of 7 billion to 70 billion. A specialized derivative, Llama 2-Chat, has been engineered explicitly for dialogue-centric applications. Benchmarking revealed Llama 2's superior performance over most extant open-source chat models. Human-centric evaluations, focusing on safety and utility metrics, positioned Llama 2-Chat as a potential contender against proprietary, closed-source counterparts. The development trajectory of Llama 2 emphasized rigorous fine-tuning methodologies. Meta's transparent delineation of these processes aims to catalyze community-driven advancements in LLMs, underscoring a commitment to collaborative and responsible AI development. Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models: Code Llama, the foundational code model;Codel Llama - Python specialized for Python;and Code Llama - Instruct, which is fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions. Based on its benchmark testing, Code Llama outperformed state-of-the-art publicly available LLMs (except GPT-4) on code tasks. Llama 2, Llama 2-Chat, and Code Llama are key steps in LLM development but still have a way to go compared to GPT-4. Meta's open access and commitment to improving these models promise transparent and faster LLM progress in the future. Please refer to the LLM and Llama variants below:  From LLMs to Multimodal LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-3.5), primarily focus on understanding and generating human language.

These are a new breed of AI models that can understand and generate not just text, but also images, sounds, and potentially other types of data. The term \"multimodal\" refers to their ability to process multiple modes or types of data simultaneously. This is a game-changer. Imagine an AI that can not only read a description of a dress but also visualize it or even design it! Multimodal AI models are moving us towards more holistic AI systems. These systems can potentially understand our world in a more comprehensive manner, bridging the gap between different forms of data and providing richer, more integrated solutions. As we stand on the cusp of this new era, it's exciting to envision the myriad of applications and innovations that Multimodal models will bring to the table. The future of AI looks more integrated and versatile than ever before.  From Connections to Vector DB The AI landscape is witnessing a fascinating transition: from Language Model (LLM) connections or integrations, e.g., LangChain and LlamaIndex, to the rise of Vector Databases (Vector DB) such as Weaviate, Milvus, Pinecone, Chroma, and Vespa.ai. But what's driving this shift, and why does it matter? LLM connections, like the LlamaIndex, primarily focus on linking and understanding vast amounts of external data. They've been pivotal in creating semantic connections, enabling more intuitive search experiences, and enhancing data accessibility. However, as the volume and variety of data grow, the need for more advanced storage and retrieval mechanisms becomes evident. This is where Vector DBs come into play.

As we navigate this evolution, it's clear that the combination of LLMs and Vector DBs will redefine how we store, access, and understand data in the AI-driven future.  From Agents to OS The AI realm is abuzz with innovations, and one of the most intriguing shifts we're witnessing is the transition from LLM agents to using LLMs as Operating Systems (OS). Let's delve into this evolution and its implications. LLM agents, like AutoGPT, AgentGPT, BabyAGI, and HuggingGPT, have been groundbreaking in automating tasks based on user requests. These agents leverage the power of Language Models (LLMs) to understand and execute commands, making them invaluable in tasks ranging from content generation to data analysis. Their adaptability and intelligence have made them a staple in many AI toolkits. However, the vision for AI doesn't stop there. The concept of LLM as an OS is emerging as the next big thing. Imagine an operating system where the core is a language model, orchestrating everything around it. Such a system would not just execute tasks but would understand context, anticipate needs, and offer solutions in real time. It's like turning the LLM into the brain of the digital ecosystem, making devices and applications more intuitive and responsive than ever.

As we stand on the brink of this transformation, the potential for LLM-driven OS to revolutionize our digital interactions is immense.  From Fine-tuning to Plugins The world of LLMs is undergoing a transformative shift, moving from intricate fine-tuning processes to the more dynamic realm of plugins. Let's unpack this evolution. Historically, fine-tuning has been the cornerstone of LLM optimization. There are two primary ways to fine-tune LLMs: feeding data into the LLM in real-time and directly fine-tuning on the LLM. From a technical standpoint, this involves three methods: Transfer Learning: Adapting a pre-trained model to new tasks.Sequential Fine-tuning: Refining models in stages for specific tasks.Task-specific Fine-tuning: Tailoring models for a particular function. Moreover, LLM techniques like In-context learning, Few-shot learning, and Zero-shot learning have further enhanced the model's adaptability, allowing them to understand and generate content with minimal data. However, the future of LLMs is leaning towards plugins. With the introduction of tools like GPT-4 Plugins, the focus is on extending LLMs seamlessly. Instead of running LLMs as a service, they're envisioned as platforms. This means integrating LLMs with various tools, enhancing their capabilities, and offering a more modular and scalable approach to AI applications. The journey from fine-tuning to plugins represents a move from static optimization to dynamic adaptability, ensuring that LLMs remain at the forefront of AI innovation.

Streamlit's open-source nature and user-friendly features simplify the process of developing web apps with minimal effort. This has made it a popular choice among developers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers seeking to build engaging and accessible applications.  Initial setup Install OpenAI, LangChain, and StreamLit Import the relevant packages Set the API keys Define the LLM to use  Ingesting private documents We used Langchain to ingest data. LangChain offers a wide range of data ingestion methods, providing users with various options to load their data efficiently. It supports multiple formats, including text, images, PDFs, Word documents, and even data from URLs. In the current example, text files were utilized, but if you wish to work with a different format, you simply need to refer to the corresponding loader specifically tailored for that format. All the analysts' recommendations documents are stored in a dedicated folder. You have the flexibility to either refer to individual documents or retrieve all the documents within a specific folder. If you want to specify exact documents, you can do it the following way. To load the files you want to ingest, you can specify the path to each file individually. The loaded files can then be saved into a list. This list serves as the input that is sent to the vector database to store the data. The alternative approach is a more versatile method in which we can load all pertinent documents from a designated folder and store the file locations in a list for subsequent processing. This approach offers flexibility and allows for the efficient handling of multiple documents by capturing their locations in a centralized list, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.

This approach offers flexibility and allows for the efficient handling of multiple documents by capturing their locations in a centralized list, enabling seamless data retrieval and analysis.  Load the documents into the vector store. When dealing with a vast number of documents, it becomes inefficient to send all documents (analyst recommendations) to your large language model (LLM) when seeking answers to specific questions. For instance, if your question pertains to MSFT, it would be more cost-effective to only send document extracts that reference MSFT to your LLM for answering the question. This approach helps optimize resource utilization. To achieve this, all documents are split into chunks and stored in a vector database in a numeric format (embeddings). When a new question is posed, the system queries the vector database for relevant text chunks related to this question, which is then shared with the LLM to generate an appropriate response. Within the LangChain framework, the VectorstoreIndexCreator class serves as a utility for creating a vector store index. This index stores vector representations of the documents (in chromadb), enabling various text operations, such as finding similar documents based on a specific question. When a user asks a question, a similarity search is performed in the vector store to get document chunks relevant to the question. The question, along with the chunks are sent to OpenAI to get the response back. Now we are ready to query these documents.

        "409b7c3a-be0f-4f1a-baf8-0017514395d6": "Problem Statement Despite the pioneers like Amazon [2], many E-commerce platforms are still heavily relying on traditional retrieval techniques like TFIDF and BM25 for product search. Such sparse methods usually require customers to type explicit queries that match the product information and mostly struggle to achieve good relevance for queries that are colloquial and implicit. In consequence, the search engine either returns no result or results with low relevance ignoring the existence of the relevant ones, which harms the customer experience and business metrics. For instance, Ebay is returning \"No exact matches found\" for the query \"What are the best gifts for boys under 5?\". Although the \"Results matching fewer words\" solution avoids the \"no result\" situation, its search relevance has got the obvious potential to be improved. People might argue that it's rare for such queries to occur. However, it's not uncommon that many opportunities and advancements are actually driven by the use cases that are underestimated in the beginning.  LLM-based Solution Today, thanks to the fast development of LLMs, one can quickly build prototypes without worrying about the effort needed to build in-house solutions from scratch. This enables my quick discovery to tackle the problem. As depicted in the image below, the idea is pretty straightforward. The LLM is leveraged to translate the raw query to an enhanced query that aims to contain the explicit product information for search. Potentially, the product range covered in the enhanced query could be broad for the raw query that is implicit and fuzzy. In consequence, sending the enhanced query directly to the keyword-based search engine will likely lead to poor results due to its ambiguity and uncertainty. As a solution, LLM embedding is adopted to address the semantic complexity. Specifically, the enhanced query is projected into the embedding space that contains the preprocessed product embeddings. Next, the product retrieval is done by comparing the similarity between the query embedding and product embeddings, which then generates the top-k products as search results. There is a wide range of techniques to implement the idea as there exist many options for each step. Here, I provide one example implementation based on Hugging Face and LangChain. The actual code is hosted on the Github repo below, with the details explained as follows.  Generate the enhanced query First, the recently announced",

Generate the enhanced query First, the recently announced Llama 2 is adopted as the LLM to generate the enhanced query for a given raw query. As demonstrated below, the Hugging Face pipeline is used, considering its simplicity. It's worth noting that the pipeline itself is enough to accomplish the task so the use of LangChain is totally optional. The prompt template adopted here aims to generate relevant and diverse product names to address the fuzziness of the raw query.  Create product embeddings Next, the sentence transformer and FAISS in LangChain are used to create and store the product embeddings based on the product titles in the inventory. Here, due to the lack of access to actual search engines, the offline Ebay product dataset \"products.csv\" is adopted as the mockup of the E-commerce product inventory. This dataset contains approximately 3,000 products covering a wide range of categories.  Product retrieval When it comes to retrieval, the same sentence transformer model that encodes the products is used again to generate the query embedding for the enhanced query. Finally, the top-10 products are retrieved based on the similarity between the query embedding and product embeddings.  Showcase To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, let's look at the above-mentioned query \"What are the best gifts for boys under 5?\" and compare the LLM enhancement with the original Ebay search results presented in Figure 1.

        "67e06e5b-a2bc-4457-af70-a3716cbeb796": "the top-10 products are retrieved based on the similarity between the query embedding and product embeddings.  Showcase To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, let's look at the above-mentioned query \"What are the best gifts for boys under 5?\" and compare the LLM enhancement with the original Ebay search results presented in Figure 1. First, after receiving the raw query, Llama 2 generates 10 products as instructed by the prompt template. They look pretty impressive for boys' gift ideas although a better product-level granularity is expected. Next, let's have a look at the similarity match in the embedding space. What are retrieved from the product inventory mockup are not bad at all in comparison with the results of the real-world Ebay search engine in Figure 1. Due to the limited product range of the inventory mockup, the comparison is somewhat unfair but we are still able to observe the significant difference before and after applying LLM. Overall, the retrieval in embedding space achieves both relevance and diversity.  Final thoughts After conducting the initial discovery, it is obvious that LLMs are a powerful tool to enhance the product search of E-commerce platforms. For this task, there are many future explorations to conduct, including prompt engineering for generating queries, product embeddings with enriched attributes, online latency optimization for LLM query enhancement, etc. Hope this blog could inspire the E-commerce platforms that need solutions to improve product search.

Common Crawl, WebText, GitHub, StackOverflow etc: These are massive datasets of text and code that are crawled from the public web and a few curated like the QA dataset SQAD. The worldview and information the model has learned are also based on this data. However, this means that if we have some domain-specific data that the model has not seen, then it won't be able on its own to answer questions related to such data in case of Closed Book QA use-case or any other use case that depends on the specific domain data. For example, most online portals are adding virtual assistants for their customers, banks, e-commerce, customer support etc. And a huge if not the majority of data in the world still lives outside of the internet in enterprises. We have seen in Part 2 how LLMs can help address information retrieval use cases based on Vector space embeddings. But what if our use case is more high level? It needs domain \"understanding\", maybe some higher level reasoning tasks. This is where fine-tuning with custom data comes into play. I am not able to provide a use case where higher-level reasoning can be used. There are a few simpler ones, like training on custom issues and then asking it to reason on similar issues and possible solutions, but these are as of now not tested. So let's stick with a simpler use-case Closed-Book QA - the model answers questions based on the knowledge it internally has for now. The above is from a 2021 paper Can Generative Pre-trained Language Models Serve as Knowledge Bases for Closed-book QA? This is already outdated in the sense of the number and size of models and training released. The authors with 2021 models could not achieve great results and the great results they found in some studies described could be attributed to the high train and test overlap in datasets.

There are also a lot of tutorials on the internet that try to portray this concept with toy datasets. The real trouble is making the model 'understand' the data first and not just parrot it out. Without understanding, it will parrot out the answer based on the similarity of the question in the training set, or both the question and answer. To prevent this, the authors have an intermediate step called 'Recite' where the model is made to recite/output the relevant passages and, after that, output the answer. Just to be clear, there is no doubt now (2023), especially with GPT3/4, LLAMA2 and similar models about the feasibility of this use case, that a model can understand the question, has some ability for causal reasoning, and can generalize to learn a world model from its training data, and to use both to create a well-formed answer to the question. Let's see the difficulties one by one however, of training a large model. First is the importance of the model size. This GIF from the Google AI blog illustrates this beautifully. It is relatively easy and cost-efficient to train or fine-tune a small model with our custom data, as the GPU and infrastructure requirements are very less. On the contrary, it needs huge fleets of GPUs and training infrastructure to load very large language models and fine-tune them (without quantisation) in a distributed way (e.g. see libraries like DeepSpeed) LLMs come in various sizes, based on the number of trainable parameters or weights. The smaller ones, which have less than 1 billion parameters (GPT2 124 M, Bloom 560M, Flan-T5 783 M ) etc can be trained on a laptop GPU with 8 to 15 GB GPU RAM ) For quite some time, this is what I tried.

I tried to overfit a small test data set on decoder models like GPP2-small, GPT-Medium, and Bloom and encoder-decoder models like Flan-T5, thinking somehow that the understanding we see in ChatGPT ( see- unsupervised learning Part 1) may come in some form if we train on these smaller models. ( less than one billion parameters). As per the paper, I tried both Causal training, where the model is presented with only previous tokens, and Masked LM-based training, where the model is presented with full tokens, but a certain percentage of tokens are masked in random, and the model has to predict it. The next option was to fine-tune a large model with the data. However, this is extremely difficult to do, and even if cloud-based solutions are used, it would be pretty expensive. (What OpenAI provides now is Instruct Fine-Tuning, which we will cover later) It takes months of GPU fleet time and a specialized library and infrastructure to distribute training across multiple GPUs needed to train LLMs. For example, even a relatively small model like the BigScience Bloom 3 Billion model, even when the weights are loaded in 16 Bit cannot be trained with A100 on ColabPro with 40GB GPU RAM ( the highest you can get) as it goes out of memory. Solution - Fine-Tuning Large Models via Qunaitsation and Parmeter Efficient Tuning The solution to this is to reduce the size of the models so that they can fit a commodity GPU and then fine-tune them.

There are two parts to this- Quantisation and Parameter Efficient Tuning. The real magic of this is that a laptop with a sufficient recent GPU (having Tensor Cores), can run the 7 billion Lamma2 pre-trained model open-sourced recently by Meta Research. Imagine the compressed knowledge and an NLU (Natural Language Understanding) model running on your local laptop. This is still a smallish model, but it's still capable of understanding and has sufficient world knowledge embedded in it to be quite useful. Imagine what a model like this or better models in the future could do if it could run in small servers or in cars, and leverage its causal reasoning and world model knowledge to supervise lower-level/specialist AI/ML systems. So we have now a way to fit reasonably large models (7B or more) in a single GPU, via Quantisation and then train them in a parameter-efficient way via LoRa/QLoRa. Take 1: Un-supervised Training Fine-tuning with QLoRa Using the small training data and QLoRA, I first tried to train a large 7B Lamma2 model by feeding in the training text as is (Causal LM model training via UnSupervised learning). Note that this model was loaded in 4-bit, making it runnable on a single T4 GPU and trained with QLoRa. With QLoRA, only a fraction of the adapter weights are trained and summed with the existing frozen pre-trained weights of the model during inference. Here is an illustrative Colab notebook. You can see that training the model with just the text as is, does not result in proper output to questions. The answers are not affected by the training data.

Take 2: Instruct Fine-tuning with QLoRa Instruction Tuning concept is a higher-level training concept introduced by this paper FineTuned Language Models Are Zero shot Learners (FLAN) We leverage the intuition that NLP tasks can be described via natural language instructions, such as \"Is the sentiment of this movie review positive or negative?\" or \"Translate 'how are you' into Chinese.\" We take a pre-trained language model of 137B parameters and perform instruction tuning ... Since we use QLoRa we are effectively closely following this paper - QLORA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs concerning the training data set, the format that the authors used to train their Gauanco model This is the format for the Llama2 model and will be different for others. One of the hardest problems of training is finding or creating a good quality data set to train. In our case, converting the available training data set to the instruction data set. Since our use case is Closed Book QA, we need to convert this to a QA format. Using older NLP methods like NER (Named Entity Recognition) and then using that to create a QA dataset was not effective. This is where the Self-instruct concept could be used However previous to Llama2, the best-performing model was the GPT 3/4 model via ChatGPT or its API and using these models to do the same was expensive. The 7 billion model of Llama2 has sufficient NLU (Natural Language Understanding) to create output based on a particular format. Running this in 4-bit mode via Quantisation makes it feasible compute-wise to run this on a large data set and convert it to a QA dataset. This was the prompt used. The",

The context was a sliding window from the text dataset. Some minimal parsing and finetuning were done on the output of the model, and we could generate a QA dataset of the format below. This was fed to the QLoRA-based fine-tuning (Colab Notebook). We can see that the output from a fine-tuned 4-bit quantized llama2 7 B model is pretty good. Colab Notebook Trying to reduce hallucination via fine-tuning In the generated dataset, I added a specific tag `Source:8989REF`. The idea was that via attention, this token will be somehow associated with the text that we were training on. And then to use this hash somehow to tweak the prompt to control hallucination. Something like \"[INST] <<SYS>>\\nYou are a helpful Question Answering Assistant. Please only answer from this reference Source:8989REF\" However, that turned out to be a very naive attempt. Also, note that the generated QA missed transforming training data related to Professor Thiersch's method to a proper QA dataset. These and other improvements need to be experimented with, as well as to train with some completely new data that the model has not seen to test more effectively. Update: Training with new data was done by writing an imaginary story with ChatGPT help and then creating an instruction tuning data set (colab notebook). The model was then trained and tested (colab notebook) with this generated instruct dataset. The results confirm that the model learns via Instruct tuning, not only the fed questions but other details and relations of the domain.
