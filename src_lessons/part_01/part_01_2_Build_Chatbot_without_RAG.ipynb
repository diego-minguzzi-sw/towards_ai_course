      "* **PyTorch:**  Another leading open-source framework, PyTorch is favored for its ease of use and dynamic computation graph, making it particularly well-suited for research and development.  Its intuitive Pythonic interface contributes to its popularity.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Keras:** While often used in conjunction with other frameworks like TensorFlow or Theano, Keras is a high-level API that simplifies the process of building and training neural networks.  It emphasizes ease of use and readability.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **MXNet:**  A scalable and flexible deep learning framework that supports multiple programming languages.  It's known for its efficiency and ability to handle large datasets.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Caffe:**  A deep learning framework known for its speed and efficiency, particularly in image processing tasks.  While still used, its development has slowed compared to others on this list.\n",
